As a malware analyst, it's essential to have a variety of bootable Linux distributions available to analyze and potentially clean infected systems. Many of these distributions can be used as live systems from .ISO files, but whether they support PXE NetBoot may vary. Here are some popular bootable Linux distributions used in malware analysis:
