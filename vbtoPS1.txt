🧠 Why Interim Releases Fit Your Criteria Best
Ubuntu has two main release types:

Release Type	Frequency	Support Duration	Stability	Freshness
LTS	Every 2 years	5+ years	Very stable	Conservative updates
Interim	Every 6 months	9 months	Less stable	Latest features, kernels, and CVE patches

🔐 Security & CVE Patch Responsiveness
Interim releases include newer kernels, drivers, and software stacks, which means more recent CVE patches are already integrated upstream.

CVEs are patched quicker in interim releases because:

They track the latest upstream versions of software.

They aren't frozen like LTS releases (which often receive only backported fixes).

For example, if a CVE is fixed in version X.3 of a package, an interim release will ship with X.3, while LTS might stick with X.1 + backports (which can lag or miss corner-case CVEs).

🧪 Why This is Ideal for a Lab
Labs are typically not production-critical.

Interim releases give you early access to features and patches, so you're always ahead in terms of CVE exposure.

They’re ideal for testing bleeding-edge software, security mitigations, and new features.

📌 Summary Recommendation
✅ Use the latest Interim Ubuntu release (currently Ubuntu 24.04, which is LTS but treated like an interim release when paired with pro disabled and upgrades enabled, or wait for 24.10 in October if you want the true interim lifecycle).

You can enable automatic upgrades to future interim releases using:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo do-release-upgrade -d
And set in /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades:

ini
Copy
Edit
Prompt=normal
